  <h1>SpiceCraft Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: August 15, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>SpiceCraft ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account information:</strong> when you sign in via AWS Cognito (Google or Apple), we collect the identifier and email address provided by the identity provider.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication tokens:</strong> OAuth tokens used to keep you signed in. Tokens are stored securely on the device (Keychain / Android Keystore).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> anonymous analytics and crash reports to improve the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the App's authentication and features.</li>
    <li>Respond to account deletion requests and support inquiries.</li>
    <li>Improve the App via analytics and crash reporting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal information. We may share data with third-party service providers (AWS Cognito, analytics providers) only as necessary to operate the App.</p>

  <h2>5. Account Deletion</h2>
  <p>You may request deletion of your account and all associated data from the App's Settings â†’ Delete Account. Account deletion will permanently remove your user profile and any associated data stored by our service. Deletion is performed by a secure backend process that calls AWS Cognito Admin APIs and deletes user data from our storage systems.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry standard protections for data at rest and in transit. OAuth tokens are stored using secure device storage (Keychain / Android Keystore). However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions about this Privacy Policy or data deletion requests, contact: <a href="mailto:privacy@spicecraft.example.com">privacy@spicecraft.example.com</a></p>

  <h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The date at the top will indicate when it was last revised.</p>
