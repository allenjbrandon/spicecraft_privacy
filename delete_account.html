  <h1>Delete Your SpiceCraft Account</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: August 20, 2025</p>

  <h2>Steps to Delete Your Account</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Open SpiceCraft.</li>
    <li>Login.</li>
    <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
    <li>Tap <strong>Delete User</strong> and confirm the deletion.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How to Request Account Deletion (prominently)</h2>
  <p>If you prefer to request deletion via email or need assistance, email <a href="mailto:spicecraftseasonings@gmail.com">spicecraftseasonings@gmail.com</a> with the subject line "Delete my SpiceCraft account" and include the email address associated with your account.</p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Deleting your account will permanently remove your user profile and associated data from the application backend.
  </div>

  <h2>What Is Deleted</h2>
  <p>When you confirm deletion, the App initiates a secure backend process to remove your account and associated personal data.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Account profile information and authentication records are deleted.</li>
    <li>User-generated content associated with your account (for example, recipes you created) will be deleted.</li>
    <li>Aggregated or anonymous analytics may be retained as described in the Privacy Policy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What May Be Retained</h2>
  <p>Records of which recipes you liked (favorites) may be retained in a de-identified or aggregated form for app integrity and analytics purposes. <strong>Retention period:</strong> These records may be retained for up to 24 months from the date of your account deletion, after which they will be deleted or irreversibly anonymized unless otherwise required by law.</p>

  <h2>Requesting Removal of Retained Records</h2>
  <p>If you want us to attempt to remove any remaining retained or de-identified records (for example, favorites), contact <a href="mailto:spicecraftseasonings@gmail.com">spicecraftseasonings@gmail.com</a>. We will evaluate such requests and, where technically feasible, delete additional records and confirm when completed.</p>

  <h2>Notes and Assumptions</h2>
  <p>Based on your instructions, this page assumes the app behavior is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The only user-related record that may remain after deletion is a record of recipes you liked.</li>
    <li>Recipes you created and associated with your account are deleted and cannot be recovered.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Assumption: I have listed a retention period of up to 24 months for retained favorites to meet Google Play's requirement to specify retention time. If you prefer a different retention period or if your backend already deletes favorites immediately, update this page and the backend policy to match your actual practice. If you want, I can change the retention wording to "indefinitely retained in de-identified form" or a different timeframe â€” tell me which you prefer.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or need assistance with account deletion, contact: <a href="mailto:spicecraftseasonings@gmail.com">spicecraftseasonings@gmail.com</a></p>
